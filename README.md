# My Tax Zimbabwe
__________________________________________
A React Based project helping one to know exactly how their tax is calculated in Zimbabwe. </br>
__________________________________________

#### Problem:
With the current Zimbabwe economy. People keep asking and wondering how much they will get paid by the end of the month, best ways to use it, and try get the USD equivalent rate.

#### Solution:
An Application that will help you get a PAYE based tax calculation. Show you value in terms of what you could use it for. And give you a few random __did you knows__

### The Initial Idea:
I'll create a simple (emphasis on __simple__ !) page that will take the user inputs and generate a tax figure. Then I intend to add more flesh to the project and have it be more insightful and thoughtful.
